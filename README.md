# speakit
Practice Italian pronounciation: Search italian text and list words containing a substring such as "ce"

From command line run `python3 speakit.py`

When prompted enter a substring e.g. "ce". Upto 15 words will be listed.

Example: 

`Type a substring or press q to quit:` \
`type ce press enter` 

Output: 

invece \
dice \
certo \
voce \
cuccetta \
cerca \
cento \
luce \
cuccette \
francesi \
fece \
faceva \
cercare \
esce \
necessario 

Note: 

Replace data.txt with whatever text file you want to use and add alongside speakit.py file

I'm using Primo Levi "If this is a man" / "Se questo Ã¨ un uomo" as a source to get frequently used words.

I had it to hand. But has a few random german words for obvious reasons.
